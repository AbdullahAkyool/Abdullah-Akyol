Hi! I'm Abdullah. I'm 25 years old. I'm a Game Developer.
I have been working on Game Development with Unity for 4 years.
I believe that game development is an art form and I'm very happy to be working in this profession. I'm always eager to learn new things and create legendary experiences. You can always get in touch with me for my projects or different topics.
