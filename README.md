About Me :)

😁 Hello. I am Abdullah. I am 24 years old. I am a Computer Programming student and a Game Developer.

🚀 I have been working on Game Development with Unity for about 3 years. I have developed many projects. I completed my internship at a game company. Then, I worked as a Junior Game Developer at a company that develops simulation games.

😎 I believe that game development is an art form and I am very happy to be working in this profession. I am very curious and enthusiastic about learning. You can contact me anytime about my projects and different topics.
